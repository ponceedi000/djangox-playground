Note: I am using Windows OS and WSL. I spent a majority of my time trying to set up my virtual environment. I was unable to install all required dependencies with poetry so I setup my Repo with Command Prompt used pipenv instead. I am able run Django commands in command prompt but when it came to pushing to GitHub, I came across some more issues. Unsure if it as an issue with my machine or with Django's latest update. Coding was the easy part, but setting up my environment ate up most of my alloted time.
